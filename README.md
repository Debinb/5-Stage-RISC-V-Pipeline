# 5-Stage-RISC-V-Pipeline
An implementation of a 5 stage RISC-V pipeline using Xilinx Vivado aiming to optimize the instruction throughput and reducing the cycle time by implementing hazard detection and forwarding mechanisms to handle data dependencies and control hazards effectively

## Features
- Multi-cycle 5 Stage Pipeline RISC V 
- Data, Structural and Control Hazard Detection
- Data Fowarding
